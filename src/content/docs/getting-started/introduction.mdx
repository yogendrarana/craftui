### Welcome!
Hello there! Thank you for visiting Craft UI. If you're using Tailwind CSS in your projects, you're in the right place! 
Craft UI offers a collection of reusable React components, styled with Tailwind and animated with Framer Motion, that you can easily copy, customize, and integrate to enhance your user experience with sleek and responsive designs.

### Inspiration
This project draws a lot of inspiration from fantastic UI collections like [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) by [Shad](https://x.com/shadcn) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design) by [Dillion Verma](https://x.com/dillionverma). 
Besides, the project is also inspired by the amazing loader collection [UI Ball](https://uiball.com/ldrs) by [Griffin Johnston](https://x.com/GriffinJohnston).

### Usage Permission
Feel free to browse the components, copy them, and make them your own! 
Iâ€™d love to see how you use them, and if you have any questions, feedback, or ideas for new components, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. 
I am always available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoogendra_rana).

#### Happy coding ðŸ™‚
