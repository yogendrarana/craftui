description: Step-by-step guide to install and configure Craft UI in your project using the Shadcn CLI.
---

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Craft UI components, you need to set up **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** in your project. Craft UI is built on top of these technologies and uses the Shadcn CLI for component installation.

### Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS

---

If you haven't already set up Tailwind CSS in your project, follow the official installation guide of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

### Step 2: Install Shadcn UI

---

Craft UI uses the Shadcn CLI to install components. Set up Shadcn UI in your project by following their official documentation [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)

This will create a `components.json` file in your project root with the default Shadcn configuration.

### Step 3: Add Craft UI Registry

---

Since Craft UI is not yet included in the default Shadcn registries, you need to manually add it to your `components.json` file.

Open your `components.json` file and add the Craft UI registry to the `registries` object:

```json {18-20}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "src/styles/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true,
    "prefix": ""
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  },
  "registries": {
    "@craftui": "https://craft-dot-ui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

**Note:** If you don't see a `registries` object in your `components.json`, simply add it as shown above.

### Step 4: Install Components

---

Once you've added the Craft UI registry, you can install any component using the Shadcn CLI with the `@craftui` prefix:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @craftui/component-name
```

For example, to install a button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @craftui/accordion
```
